The dataset can be downloaded from  https://github.com/manoja328/tallyqa/blob/master/tallyqa.zip?raw=true. The zip contains two files for train and test respectively.

Each entries in the test.json contains a question , answer, image-id , image and a flag ( issimple) to denote 
whether the question is simple or complex. All the images are from ms-COCO and Visual Genome. The quesiton answer pairs
have been derived from TDIUC, VQA2.0 and also using AMT annotators. The field 'data_source' shows the source of the QA pair.
