# TallyQA

The dataset can be downloaded from  https://github.com/manoja328/tallyqa/blob/master/tallyqa.zip?raw=true. The zip contains json files for train and test respectively.

Each entries in the test contains a question , answer, image-id , image,  a flag ( **issimple**) to denote 
whether the question is simple or complex, and  the field 'data_source' shows the source of the QA pair. All the images
are from COCO and Visual Genome. The quesiton answer pairs have been derived from TDIUC, VQA2.0 and also using AMT annotators.
